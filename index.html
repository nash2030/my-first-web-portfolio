   <h2>About Me</h2>
   <p>I never knew programming could be so fascinating like this.I am currently pursuing a ,Bachelor of Commerce,
     degree at The Technical University of Kenya, after completing my high schooling at Kisii High School.
   I never knew I had passion for software engineering until when I started attending computer packages sessions,and their I acquired
 many skills that I can use to solve problems.I have some skills in warehousing,since I once worked as a warehouse assistant.Most of the
problems in the society today can be solved technologically and this really made me have that zeal of wanting know more about programming so
as to solve these problems.</p>
