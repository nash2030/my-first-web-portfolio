      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>Iam excited to be a programmer and am working to making a difference in the lives of not only those who need my help
      but also bringing change in the Information Technology Industry through my invention.I remember some years back being so naive as a child because I had
      the perception that programming was all about technicalities and having a brilliant mind.I thought it was very difficult until I decided to give it a try,through
      the <span>Secondary School Program Curriculum</span>,only to find out that it was the simplest course to practice and learn.
      Through the experience I got at the program and the knowledge imparted in me,my programming skills were taken a notch higher and I believe the <span>PREP and CORE </span>classes at Moringa School will
      sharpen my programming skills further.I come to this profession with definite beliefs in mind in relation to who I will be as a successful programmer,developer and problem solver too.
      Having invented a Mathematical formula way back in high school,which helped solve mathematical problems,I believe with more specialisation in this sector ,I will come up with inventions that will too help solve the problems
      of people in the community.One of the skills I will utilize is teamwork by working together with others to give out a more desired output.I will not only work with others,but am a good listener too,willing to respond in kind to all ideas presented by the programming community.
      I will also respond well to change by being open to learn from others through trying new approaches in programming.</p>
